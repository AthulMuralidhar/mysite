        It is 2019. Almost twenty years have passed since the new century has dawned. What a time to be alive!
      </p>
      <p>But, why are we still using locks and keys to open doors? Is it just me who gets pissed off of using (annoying) keys to open doors in winter? Wow, humans really are retarted. Including me ofcourse. There is obviously a lag between what the great thinkers of the 60s and 70s thought would happen and what has actually happened. Ofcourse, some of the things that were predicted are now a reality, but others are not. Some even trivial things like lock and keys, and window panes are still the same old, same old. This blog is precicely about this.
